# MICA-PNI: Multimodal Imaging and Connectome Analysis- Precision Neuroimaging and Connectomics Dataset 

Multimodal neuroimaging has advanced our understanding of the human brain by allowing non-invasive examination of brain structure and function. Precision neuroimaging builds upon this foundation by mapping neural activity and connectivity patterns with enhanced fidelity using repeated and prolonged scans, resulting in a more precise and individualized understanding of brain organization. Harnessing ultra-high field (UHF) neuroimaging at magnetic field strengths of 7 Tesla can further enhance spatial and temporal resolution, for precise mapping of cortical and deep structures. Here, we provide a multimodal precision neuroimaging dataset, which capitalized on UHF 7T MRI acquisitions across multiple sessions. Our UHF imaging protocol was implemented at the Montreal Neurological Institute and data were acquired on a 7T Siemens Magnetom Terra scanner with the 8/32-channel transmit/receive Nova head coil. Ten healthy individuals (4M/6F, age=26.8Â±4.61, left/right handed=2/8) underwent three imaging sessions, each consisting of distinct structural and functional imaging protocols. In the initial release, we share (i) magnetization prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient (MP2RAGE)-derived T1w and (ii) T1 relaxometry (T1) for examining intracortical microstructural organization, as well as included (iii) rs-fMRI data to probe intrinsic brain function. Our open-access precision UHF dataset promises to become a key resource for researchers aiming to advance our understanding of structure-function relationships in individual human brains and is instrumental in the development of novel image processing and analysis methodology.
